        		<h1>Welcome to RAW__GALLERY.</h1>
				<p>This is my homepage for a starter project I'm doing within my visual/graphic design studio, 'RAW__GALLERY'. My goal is to quickly learn visual design techniques via HTML and CSS. <em>Cue applause.</em>  For some content, here is a bit about me: I like to describe myself as a "matchmaker" between users and products, driven by my passion for leveraging the intrinsic power of brands in new ways.

Combining a background in logistics and supply chain with in-field marketing and UX experience, I utilize qualitative research methods and highlight product characteristics and demographic themes in order to cultivate a relationship between a user and product or service.

In my experience as a brand manager and marketer, I've facilitated digital promotions and curated digital content for promotional campaigns featuring Rick Ross, Jennifer Lopez, and Donald Glover, and more.

I've contributed to several large-scale UX strategy projects, integrating comprehensive visual design, closely examining cultural themes and trends, and experimenting with disruptive consumer-facing technology- most recently including blockchain in logistics contract management services.

I thoroughly enjoy and am comfortable diving into existing processes, and establishing a clear distinction between current- and target-state. While working towards my Bachelor's degree in Logistics, Materials & Supply Chain Management, I completed several business analysis internships at Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles N.V., and later for Cisco Systems, in global fulfillment and operations planning, respectively.

I joined Accenture, LLC in June 2017,  and am currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. <a href="/about">Let's connect: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronald-walker-iii-2a33a67a/...</a></p>
