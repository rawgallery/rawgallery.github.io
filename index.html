        		<h1>I'm Ron Walker!</h1>
				<p>This is my homepage for a starter project I'm doing within my visual/graphic design studio, 'RAW__GALLERY'. My goal is to quickly learn visual design techniques via HTML and CSS. <em>Cue applause.</em>  For some content, here is my professional bio (also found on my LinkedIn): A graduate of Howard University's School of Business, Ronald is a "matchmaker" between users and products, driven by a passion for leveraging the intrinsic power of brands in new ways.

Combining a background in logistics and supply chain with in-field marketing and UX experience, Ronald utilizes qualitative research methods, highlighting product characteristics and demographic themes to drive a user's relationship with a product or service.

An experienced brand manager and marketer, Ronald facilitated digital promotions and curated digital content for promotional campaigns featuring Rick Ross, Jennifer Lopez, and Donald Glover, and more.

Ronald has a track record of contributing to several large-scale UX strategy projects, integrating comprehensive visual design, closely examining cultural themes and trends, and experimenting with disruptive consumer-facing technology, most recently including blockchain in logistics contract management services.

Ronald fearlessly deep-dives into existing processes, establishing a clear distinction between current- and target-state.  Ronald completed several business analysis internships at Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles N.V., and later for Cisco Systems, in supply chain management and global S&OP planning, respectively.

Ronald joined Accenture, LLC in June 2017,  and is based in San Francisco, California. <a href="/about">Let's connect: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronald-walker-iii-2a33a67a/...</a></p>
